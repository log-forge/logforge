Visibility that acts: alerts and safe auto-fix.

## üöÄ Quick Start - v2.0.0

```bash
git clone https://github.com/log-forge/logforge.git
cd logforge
docker compose up -d --build
```
Then open: http://localhost:3008

Default container names are logforge-frontend, logforge-backend, logforge-alert-backend, logforge-alert-frontend, logforge-autoupdate and logforge-notifier.
Default ports are 3008 (logforge-core frontend), 8087 (logforge-notifier) and 3033 (logforge-alertengine).
If you want to change them, edit the `.env` file.

```
# Container names (change names here)
LOGFORGE_BACKEND_CONTAINER_NAME=logforge-backend
LOGFORGE_FRONTEND_CONTAINER_NAME=logforge-frontend
ALERT_ENGINE_BACKEND_CONTAINER_NAME=logforge-alert-backend
ALERT_ENGINE_FRONTEND_CONTAINER_NAME=logforge-alert-frontend
AUTOUPDATE_SERVICE_NAME=logforge-autoupdate
NOTIFIER_SERVICE_CONTAINER_NAME=logforge-notifier

# Host ports exposed by default (Select what ports the UI open to on your machine)
LOGFORGE_FRONTEND_PORT=3008
NOTIFIER_WEB_PORT=8087
ALERT_ENGINE_FRONTEND_PORT=3033

#auto-update, if you want to disable auto-updates, change to "false"
AUTO_UPDATE=true
```

Then go to the correct port you set in .env for the frontend (`LOGFORGE_FRONTEND_PORT`)

\* Note: We **strongly** suggest you leave `AUTO_UPDATE` as `true`

# Alert Engine
Rules, notifications, and automation. All in the browser. Configure everything in the UI.

Alert Engine turns signals into action: define rules for logs, metrics, and container events, then notify your channels or remediate safely with restart, stop, kill, start, or scripts. Built‚Äëin cooldowns, backoff, rate limits, and verification delays keep automation under control.

### ‚ú® Features

## Source‚ÄëAvailable (Core)
The [LogForge Core](https://github.com/log-forge/logforge-core) backend interfaces directly with the Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`). For transparency and safety, Core is source‚Äëavailable so you can review exactly what runs with that level of access.

\* Note: `logforge-autoupdate` also uses the socket, it is just [watchtower](https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower) with custom scheduling settings.

Non‚ÄëCore components (Alert Engine, Notifier, and other tools) are proprietary/restricted. See LICENSING.md for details.
