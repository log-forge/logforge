# LogForge 🛠️

Self-hosted service monitoring dashboard for Docker containers.

Built for developers who want **simple** log visibility, service crash detection, and real-time alerts — without needing to stitch together multiple heavy tools.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/madanb13/log-forge.git
cd log-forge
docker compose up -d
```
Then open: http://localhost:3000

Default ports are 3000 (frontend) and 8000 (backend).
If you want to change them, edit the .env file.
Then go to the correct port you set in .env for the frontend
