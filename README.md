## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/log-forge/logforge.git
cd logforge
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```
Then open: http://localhost:3000

Default container names are logforge-frontend, logforge-backend and logforge-notifier.
Default ports are 3000 (frontend), 8000 (backend) and 8083/8085 (notifier).
If you want to change them, edit the .env file.

```
# Sets the name for the container that will run the backend service.
# This name is used to identify the container
BACKEND_SERVICE_CONTAINER_NAME="logforge-backend"
# Specifies the port number the backend application inside the container listens on for incoming connections.
BACKEND_SERVICE_PORT="8000"
# Defines the port number on your host machine (your computer) that will forward traffic to the BACKEND_SERVICE_PORT inside the container.
# In this case, accessing http://localhost:8000 on your machine will connect to port 8000 inside the backend container.
EXPOSED_BACKEND_PORT="8000"

# Sets the name for the container running the frontend service.
FRONTEND_SERVICE_CONTAINER_NAME="logforge-frontend"
# Specifies the port number that the frontend application (the web server) listens on inside its container.
FRONTEND_SERVICE_PORT="3000"
# Defines the port number on your host machine that maps to the FRONTEND_SERVICE_PORT inside the container.
# Accessing http://localhost:3000 on your machine will connect to port 3000 inside the frontend container.
EXPOSED_FRONTEND_PORT="3000"

# Sets the name for the container running the notifier service
NOTIFIER_SERVICE_CONTAINER="logforge-notifier"
# Specifies the port number the notficaiton service uses to send notfications
NOTIFIER_PLAIN_PORT="8083"
# Defines the port number the norfication service uses for the web UI
NOTIFIER_WEB_PORT="8085"

# Sets the name for rhe container running the auto-update service
AUTOUPDATE_SERVICE_NAME="logforge-autoupdate"
```

\* Then go to the correct port you set in .env for the frontend
