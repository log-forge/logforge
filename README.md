## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/madanb13/log-forge.git
cd log-forge
docker compose up -d --build
```
Then open: http://localhost:3000

Default container names are logforge-frontend and logforge-backend.
Default ports are 3000 (frontend) and 8000 (backend).
If you want to change them, edit the .env file.

```
# Sets the name for the container that will run the backend service.
# This name is used to identify the container
BACKEND_SERVICE_CONTAINER_NAME=logforge-backend
# Specifies the port number the backend application inside the container listens on for incoming connections.
BACKEND_SERVICE_PORT=8000
# Defines the port number on your host machine (your computer) that will forward traffic to the BACKEND_SERVICE_PORT inside the container.
# In this case, accessing http://localhost:8000 on your machine will connect to port 8000 inside the backend container.
EXPOSED_BACKEND_PORT=8000

# Sets the name for the container running the frontend service.
FRONTEND_SERVICE_CONTAINER_NAME=logforge-frontend
# Specifies the port number that the frontend application (the web server) listens on inside its container.
FRONTEND_SERVICE_PORT=3000
# Defines the port number on your host machine that maps to the FRONTEND_SERVICE_PORT inside the container.
# Accessing http://localhost:3000 on your machine will connect to port 3000 inside the frontend container.
EXPOSED_FRONTEND_PORT=3000
```

\* Then go to the correct port you set in .env for the frontend
