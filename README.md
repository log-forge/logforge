# LogForge 🛠️

Self-hosted service monitoring dashboard for Docker containers.

Built for developers who want **simple** log visibility, service crash detection, and real-time alerts — without needing to stitch together multiple heavy tools.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/madanb13/log-forge.git
cd log-forge
docker compose up -d
```
Then open: http://localhost:3000

Default ports are 3000 (frontend) and 8000 (backend).
If you want to change them, edit the .env file.
Then go to the correct port you set in .env for the frontend

## Why LogForge?
LogForge was built for developers who need a simple, lightweight way to monitor services during development — without setting up huge production systems.

LogForge is optimized for ***developer environments***:

🔹 Instantly see which services are running, crashed, or stopped

🔹 View and filter logs per service

🔹 Get alerts when internal services show errors or warnings based on keywords you set

🔹 Deploy everything in seconds with a single command

Built for dev environments, not production — fast, simple, and focused. No complex setup. No huge monitoring stacks.

Deploy in seconds with one simple command.
